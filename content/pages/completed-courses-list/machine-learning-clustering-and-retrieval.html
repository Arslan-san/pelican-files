<h1>About course</h1>

	<p> 
	
	So, I am going to share the things that I learnt during the course (Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval).
	Basically this course is about different types of algorithms that we used for the clustering and retrieval purpose
	like 1-NN, k-NN for retrieval and k-mean, k-mean++,LDA(is an example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic), gaussian mixture model(is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters) for clustering and how we handle diffrent problems that may occur during clustering and retrieval.
	Now I will list all the things which I understand mostly.
